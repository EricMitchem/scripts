# Minecraft scripts

## RedPower2 Forth Drill

A Forth script for operating a large drill in the RedPower2 mod.

## minecraft bash script

A bash script for managing the startup and shutdown of a ram disk and a modded minecraft server through a tmux session. My server hardware at the time of writing this script was a very old laptop. It wasn't performant enough with regards to disk io. So, I ran the minecraft server on a ram disk to increase performance. In hindsight, this script became too large and should've been written in Python or something similar.
